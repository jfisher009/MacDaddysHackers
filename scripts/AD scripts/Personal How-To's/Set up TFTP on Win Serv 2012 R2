it was my starting point. I've left a simplified walkthrough below, so that you do not have to suffer as I have.
If you are lost though, feel free to take a look at the walkthrough. it includes screenshots that might be helpful ~Jacob~


In Server Manager, install the "Windows Deployment Services" role in the "Add Roles and Features Wizard". Then, in "Role Services" only select "Transport Server." Click next and install.
Open file manager and create a folder here > C:\tftp
open Registry Editor (powershell: "regedit") and navigate to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\WDSServer\Providers\WDSTFTP
Create a new string paramater with the name "RootFolder" and set the value to the folder you created earlier (C:\tftp)
Start WDS with this command: WDSUTIL /Start-TransportServer
Now return to the "Add Roles and Features Wizard" in Server Manager. Install the "TFTP Client" feature, and the "Deployment Server" role you deselected earlier from the WDS Section. 
In Server Manager, in the left column select "WDS", right click the server, and click "Windows Deployment Services Management Console"
Expand Servers and right click the server. Click Configure Server
Click Next, Next, and on the "Folder Location" screen, change the path from "C:\RemoteInstall" to "C:\tftp" Click "yes" on the pop up and hit next. Do not integrate with AD, make it a standalone server.
Click next and ensure the "add images to the server now" box is checked. Click Finish, then cancel.
Create a file in the C:\tftp\boot folder called test.txt. This will be the file you test the tftp server with. 
Remove the "Deployment Server" role you installed earlier through the "remove roles and features wizard" in server manager.
Restart the server.
Run the following command to test the tftp server: tftp -i localhost get boot\test.txt
You should see that the file has successfully downloaded.

On the client, enable the tftp client role (possibly turn off firewall for a minute)
